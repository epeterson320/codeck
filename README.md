# Cryptodeck
Encode a string of text in the ordering of a deck of cards.

I've always thought it would be cool to use a deck of cards to encode a secret
message. This is a work in progress, but the goal is to make a small web app to
do the transformation of text to and from an ordered deck of cards.

The whole process is
Deck -> Permutation -> Factoradic -> Binary -> Bijective -> Text
