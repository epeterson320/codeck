    <h3>What's going on here?</h3>
    <p>A few years ago while playing
    cards, I had an idea. More like a question, really: could you encode a
    message in a deck of cards? Is that mathematically possible?</p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, I realized <em>hey</em>, you can Google that sort of
    thing. Google lead me to a stack overflow article called
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1506078/fast-permutation-number-permutation-mapping-algorithms">
    Fast permutation -> number -> permutation mapping algorithms</a>.
    That introduced me to the word I was looking for: <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system">Factorial
    number system</a>, and the related concept of <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_code">Lehmer codes</a>, so I
    went straight to Wikipedia and began to figure out what I had gotten myself
    into. The good news was that mathematicians have studied this thing and
    come up with some great research.</p>
    <p>Once I figured out how it was possible to encode a message in a deck of
    cards, I made this web app to demonstrate it was possible, and that brings
    us to what you're looking at now.</p>

    <h3>How long can the messages be?</h3>
    <p>
      That depends on two things: How many cards are in a deck, and how many
      letters are in your alphabet. Since there are fifty-two cards in a deck,
      there are <code>52! ≈ 8✖️10<sup>57</sup></code> possible orders for a deck
      of cards. If your alphabet has 39 letters (26 proper letters, 10 digits,
      space, quote, and period), then you will need to be able to store
      39<sup>l</sup> messages, where <i>l</i> is the maximum length of a
      message.
    </p>
    <p>This gives us the following formula to solve for <i>l</i>:</p>
    <code>52! ≥ 39<sup>l</sup></code>
    <p>
      This equation can be solved for l by asking Siri, "What's the log of 52
      factorial divided by the log of 39?" The answer will be about 42.68, which
      rounds down to a maximum length of 42 characters, since it doesn't make
      sense to encode part of a character.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it named Codeck?</h3>
    <p>A <b>codec</b> is a word for something that encodes and decodes messages,
      and I'm not one to pass up a good pun. Or a bad one, apparently.</p>
    <h3>How was this built?</h3>
    <p>The styles and code are my own, but I got a lot of help from a data
      visualization library called <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> (not
      affiliated with this project). All the code I wrote is available on Github
      at <a href="https://github.com/epeterson320/codeck">Codeck</a>.</p>
